    <h3 class="h3">College and Major</h3>
    <img src="multipleanimals.jpg" width="300x">
    <p>I want to go to Michigan State for the Veterinary School after my 4 undergrad years there. I would like to major in Animal Science and have a minor in zoology.</p>
    <p>I am striving to attend Michigan State University to have the best opportunity to get into the Veterinary School they have. Their vet school is one of the best in the country and I want to have the best education possible to do the field of work I am interested in. I want to be best equiped with knowledge and resources to become a successful veternarian.</p>

    <h3 class="h3">Career Aspirations</h3>
    <img src="vets.jpg" width="250c">
    <p>I am between various career paths in the future, but I know for sure I want to be apart of a field that has to do with animals. I want to have a veterinary license so I am equipt to help and work with animals, but long term I am not sure if I want to have my own practice or start an organization where I can rescue animals. I am very interested in rescuing and helping animals in need and that is what my heart is drawn to. I do not want to stay in the USA forever, I might move out of the country. I know for sure I am set on traveling the world in my lifetime and I hope that I will be able to practice animal medicine or use my skills to help animals all over the world. If I had to stay in the USA, I would stay in this area of Michigan. If I was not to live in the United States, somewhere across the ocean that needs help with endangered species.

       <h3 class="h3">Color Choice</h3>
       <p>I chose this color choice of black, pink, green, and blue for visual purposes, but also because I think they represent me. The black makes the words stand out and I believe I stand out in a crowd of people. My favorite colors are the shades of pink green and blue that I chose. I love colors that go together and these 3 of my 4 favorite colors go together extremely well.</p>
