    <h1>Life Before Fame</h1>
    <p>On February 16, 1990, Abel Makkonen Tesfaye was born in Ontario, Canada. When he was just a toddler, his parents seperated leaving just him and his mom. They both lived in the tough Scarborough neighborhood of Toronto.
        As a child, Abel was very introverted and shy. When he was 11th grade, he dropped out of school and left home, devoting his life to full time partying. Eventually, he ended up landing a job at American Apparel, and began writing music. He uploaded some of his first songs on Youtube in 2011. 
        A few of his videos were major hits and gained the attention of producers. He then signed a record label, and he founded XO Labels.
