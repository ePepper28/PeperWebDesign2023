	    <h1> Popular Programming Languages </h1>
	    <p> Two kinds of programming languages are <em>compiled</em>
	        and <em>scripting</em>.  Compiled language code is first 
	        processed by a compiler, which produces an executable for you
	        to run.  Scripting language code is still compiled first,
	        but it is compiled "on the fly", and is immediately run
	        for you.
	    </p>
