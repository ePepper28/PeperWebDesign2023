        <h1>Veterinarian:a medical professional who knows how to treat injured or hurt animals. </h1>
        <h2>Animal Sciences and Biology</h2>
        <p>This career is pertaining to the caretaking and healing of injured animals. There are vets your dogs go to,
            but also vets that take care of larger animals like elephants. I will be studying animal sciences and
            biology to best understand the reasoning injured animals are how they are and how I can best help them. I am
            not sure if I want to specify a certain type of animal I want to take care of but I know I want to travel
            all over the world to help exotic animals and make sure they are healthy. I especially want to help
            endangered animals.</p>
        <p>I am interested in this career because I love animals and the environment is extremely important to me. Since
            it is so important to me, I want to help animals who are going extinct or at risk for health issues. I want
            to help rescue and heal animals. I want to combine my love for nature and the environment but also animals
            at the same time.</p>
