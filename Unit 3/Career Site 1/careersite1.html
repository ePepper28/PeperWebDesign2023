    <p>This career is pertaining to the caretaking and healing of injured animals. There are vets your dogs go to, but also vets that take care of larger animals like elephants. I will be studying animal sciences and biology to best understand the reasoning injured animals are how they are and how I can best help them. I am not sure if I want to specify a certain type of animal I want to take care of but I know I want to travel all over the world to help exotic animals and make sure they are healthy. I especially want to help endangered animals.</p>
